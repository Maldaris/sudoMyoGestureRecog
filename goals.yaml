Armband:
  -Get basic connect usage working
  -design event plugin system
  -Design supported gestures (DITCH THE FUCKING FIST BULLSHIT)
  -Design gesture library's regcognizer for gestures
  Needs:
    -Simplex recognition of basic guesture modes (spread, wave out, touch, etc)
    -complex recognition of per-frame movement (rotation, postition composite)
  Wants:
    -customizable margin of error (radius from original line based?)
    -keyframe density customization

Atom:
    -Triage useful macros that require a hand to leave the keyboard to be useful (opening project folders?)
    -peek at atom package structure and decide if total plugin or separate
    standalone runtime is necessary

Notes:
  -Fist recognition requires way too much effort, swap with hand spread
  -Apparently not when you calibrate it properly >.>
  -does individual fingers work? (for thumb touch)
  -Myo lib does `.on()` style events. there needs to be a way to poll
    continously.
  -Group accelerometer data?
  -IMU or EMG?
  -Definitely IMU
  -`myo.streamIMU(true);`
